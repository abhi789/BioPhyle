BioPhyle was a project done to help make learninng the Gapsmis sequence alignment algorithm easy. This is a web app and can be used on any device. The Gapsmis sequence alignment algorithm involves using multiple matrices to find the sequence alignment. Our gamified app has difficult levels and concepts like leaderboards, time limits and difficulty levels to make learning the algorithm more fun.
